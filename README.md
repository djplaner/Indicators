# Indicators

### About

The plan is that this will be a collection if Jupyter Notebooks attempting to look for interesting indicators within Moodle LMS (and other) data. 

The primary aim is to help progress [the Indicators project](https://indicatorsproject.wordpress.com/) in ways that work toward ideas of reproducible research.

A longer term aim might become to explore how this type of "platform" might be useful within an institution.

[This blog post](http://djon.es/blog/2017/03/08/thinking-about-more-reproducible-research-and-learning-analytics/) describes the origins of the idea.
