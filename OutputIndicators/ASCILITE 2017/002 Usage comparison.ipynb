    "The graphs in [the original Indicators paper](https://indicatorsproject.wordpress.com/2009/10/09/the-indicators-project-identifying-effective-learning-adoption-activity-grades-and-external-factors/) that allow comparison of LMS feature adoption longitudinally across a number of years using the Malikowski model, are based on feature adoption. i.e. if a feature has been added to the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would appear more useful to focus on actual usage of these features, rather than adoption. This notebook aims to create a similar comparison of features across the years using the Malikowski model, but this time based on clicks per student.\n",
